    "An Inertial measurement unit (IMU) comprises accelerometers, gyroscopes and \n",
    "magnetometers and allows to estimate the pose of a rigid body. The gyroscope \n",
    "provides measurements of the angular velocity and from the measurements of the \n",
    "accelerometer and of the magnetometer one can extract measurements of the three \n",
    "angles (Euler angles according to a given convention) characterizing the attitude. \n",
    "In a simple linear model the kynematic equations for the three angles are decoupled. \n",
    "In particular, one can simply consider the following model\n",

    "the angular velocity, the torque and the moment of inertial about the corresponding \n",
